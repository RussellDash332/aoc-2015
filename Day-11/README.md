```cqjxjnds```

By trying to maintain `cqjxj`, we won't be able to make an incrasing substring and a double pair at the same time. So try to maintain `cqjx` instead. Logical deduction brings us to `cqjxxyzz`.

After this, nothing can be done if the password starts with `cqjy` and `cqjz`. Hence we go to `cqka` and we finally arrived at `cqkaabcc` as the next password.
